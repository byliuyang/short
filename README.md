## Preview

![Demo](doc/demo.gif)

## Get `s/` Chrome extension

Install it from [Chrome Web Store](https://short-d.com/r/ext) or build it
from [source](https://short-d.com/r/ext-code)

## Getting Started

### Accessing the source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/byliuyang/short.git
```

### Prerequisites

- Docker v19.03.2

### Configure environmental variables

1. Create `.env` file at project root with the following content:

   ```env
   DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=local
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   DB_NAME=your_db_name
   RECAPTCHA_SECRET=your_recaptcha_secret
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_Github_client_id
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET= your_Github_client_secret
   JWT_SECRET= your_JWT_secret
   WEB_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   WEB_PORT=3000
   HTTP_API_PORT=80
   GRAPHQL_API_PORT=8080
   ```
   
1. Update `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, and `JWT_SECRET` with your own
   configurations.

### Create reCAPTCHA account

1. Sign up at [ReCAPTCHA](https://short-d.com/r/recaptcha) with the
   following configurations:

   | Field           | Value          |

   | reCAPTCHA type  | `reCAPTCHAv3`  |
   | Domains         | `localhost`    |

1. Replace the value of `RECAPTCHA_SECRET` in the `.env` file with `SECRET KEY`.

   `frontend/.env.development` file with `SITE_KEY`.

### Create Github OAuth Application

1. Create a new OAuth app at
   [Github Developers](https://short-d.com/r/ghdev) with the
   following configurations:
   
   | Field                      | Value                                            |

   | Application description    | `URL shortening service written in Go and React` |
   | Authorization callback URL | `http://localhost/oauth/github/sign-in/callback` |

1. Replace the value of `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` in the `.env` file with `Client ID`.
1. Replace the value of `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in the `.env` file with
   `Client Secret`.

### Generate static assets

Run the following commands at project root:

```bash
docker build -t frontend-build -f Dockerfile-build .
docker run -v $(pwd)/frontend/build:/app/build frontend-build:latest
```

### Build frontend & backend docker images

```bash
docker build -t short-frontend:latest -f frontend/Dockerfile frontend
docker build -t short-backend:latest -f backend/Dockerfile backend
```

### Launch App

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Development

### Dependencies

- Go v1.13.1
- Node.js v12.12.0
- Yarn v1.19.1
- Postgresql v12.0 ( or use [ElephantSQL](https://short-d.com/r/sql) instead )

### Backend

1. Create `.env` under `backend` directory with the following content:

   ```env
   DB_HOST=your_db_host
   DB_PORT=your_db_port
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   DB_NAME=your_db_name
   RECAPTCHA_SECRET=your_recaptcha_secret
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_Github_client_id
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_Github_client_secret
   JWT_SECRET=your_JWT_secret
   WEB_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```
   
1. Update `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`,
   `RECAPTCHA_SECRET`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `JWT_SECRET`
   with your own configurations.

1. Launch backend server

## System Design

### Database Modeling

![Entity Relation Diagram](doc/eng/db/er-v1.png)

## Deployment

Merging from `master` branch to `production` branch on Github will automatically
deploy the latest code to the production server. This is called continuous
delivery in the DevOps world.

![Continuous Delivery](doc/eng/devops/continuous-delivery.png)

In the future, when there are enough automated tests, we may migrate to
continuous deployment instead.
